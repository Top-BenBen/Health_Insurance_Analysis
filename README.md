# Health_Insurance_Analysis

#### Introduction to the Healthcare Data Analysis Project

This project delivers a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of healthcare operations by leveraging data from four core entities: patients, claims, payments, and providers. The primary objective is to uncover patterns in healthcare usage, financial behavior, and potential fraud indicators. The analysis explores demographic insights, claim and payment activity, and provider performance, enabling data-driven decisions for operational optimization and risk mitigation. Beyond descriptive analytics, the project also applies investigative queries across joined datasets to flag anomalous behaviors — such as duplicate claims, overbilling, and geographic inconsistencies — that may indicate fraud. The end goal is to support smarter healthcare delivery, cost control, and enhanced integrity in health insurance ecosystems.

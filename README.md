# Health_Insurance_Analysis

#### Introduction to the Healthcare Data Analysis Project

This project delivers a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of healthcare operations by leveraging data from four core entities: patients, claims, payments, and providers. The primary objective is to identify patterns in healthcare utilisation, financial behaviour, and potential indicators of fraud. The analysis explores demographic insights, claim and payment activity, and provider performance, enabling data-driven decisions for operational optimisation and risk mitigation. Beyond descriptive analytics, the project also applies investigative queries across joined datasets to flag anomalous behaviours, such as duplicate claims, overbilling, and geographic inconsistencies, that may indicate fraud. The end goal is to support smarter healthcare delivery, cost control, and enhanced integrity in health insurance ecosystems.
